# **CROP YIELD PREDICTION**
## INTRODUCTION
* Agriculture plays a vital role in **food production and the economy**.
* Farmers struggle to estimate yield due to unpredictable weather, soil conditions, and other factors.
* **Uncertainty in crop yield** affects planning, resource allocation, and profitability.
* **Data-driven yield predictions** improve decision-making, manages steady supply of crops and ensures food security.
* **Machine learning model** analyze data like weather, soil type, and farming practices to predict yields.

## OBJECTIVE:
* The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts crop yield based on various environmental and agricultural factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil type, weather conditions, fertilizer and irrigation use.

## DATASET OVERVIEW:
This dataset contains agricultural data for 70000 samples aimed at predicting crop yield (in tons per hectare) based on various factors. The dataset is used for regression tasks in machine learning, especially for predicting crop productivity.
